This system has two main functionalities which are to record temperature and to detect LPG (liquified petroleum gas). It regulates the speed of the fan with respect to the recorded temperature. When LPG is detected by the sensor, a buzzer is set, and the user is alerted that the LPG leak has been detected. This project changes the speed of the fan according to the temperature and thus helpful in making a power saving system.
